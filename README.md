#Little Platformer
*Copyright 2013 Robert Sikorski - See LICENSE.md for details.*

A simple platformer written in JavaScript and HTML5.

This game is my ~~second~~ third entry in [OneGameAMonth](onegameamonth.com)(1GAM). Compared to my first 
game, this will be more complicated, but I have the advantage of having done something similar
to this before. Admittedly, I'm not too familiar with JavaScript or even HTML/CSS, but since
this project is just a basic version of what I'm doing for next month, that should still be
manageable.

The main goal for this project is to create a platformer with the following criteria:
* State Based Game
* Read and parse XML data for maps (Tiled maps)
* Use ~~graphics for maps, player, environment (monsters?)~~ HTML5 canvas shapes for graphics
* Use sound

The goal of this game is really to create the classes and such that I need for the next game.
I know there are existing systems out there for making platforming games that will be better
written and more extensive than my own, but since the goal of this for me is to code, the
more technical problems I'm solving, the better.

### Running Little Platformer
Download the files, upload them to a webserver, and navigate to
(your webserver)/LittlePlatformer.html. You can't run the game directly from your computer
(unless you fanangle a set up to circumvent same-origin security policies, which is doable)
which is why I recommend just uploading it somewhere.

Alternately, you can play the game from my own website - once the game is running, I will
post a link here.
